# ML4IoTCourse

Laboraties done during the Machine Learning for IoT course at PoliTo.

Topics covered:
1. Gather data using sensors: 
      * DHT-11 (temperature and humidity),
      * USB Microfophone.

2.  * Pre-Processing of Audio Signals:
      * Resampling,
      * Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT),
      * Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs).
    * Image pre-processing
    
3.  * Training networks for:
      * Temperature and Humidity Forecasting
      * Keyword Spotting
    * deployment of the trained networks
    
4.  Optimizations:
      * Post-Training Quantization (PTQ)
      * Structured Pruning via Width Scaling
      * Structured Pruning via Width Scaling

5. RESTfull applications

6. MQTT applications
